              <p>So you are interested in learning Archery at the best little Archery Club in Upper Hutt? Brilliant!
                Well, you've come to the right place then.<br><br>For those of you who have never participated in the
                sport we offer beginner's courses and for former archers returning to the sport we can brush off that
                rustiness that will have crept in.<br>Trentham Archery Club has several Archery New Zealand accredited
                coaches, most are Level 1 (Development) but we also have three Level 2 coaches. Beginner's courses are
                run from early Spring to late Autumn. We try avoid mid winter as there are too many lost days due to bad
                weather which prolongs the course and causes people to lose interest. For further information on
                beginner's courses, including costs, or you wish to be put on the waiting list for the next course,
                please contact the Club Secretary (see the Contact Us page of this site).<br><br>Trentham Camp Archery
                Club is operates from the Sommerville Range in Trentham, Upper Hutt (see Visit Us for directions to the
                range). Beginner's courses are held on Sundays. Session times depend on the demand, if there are too
                many people for one session then we may run two sessions, the first from 10am till noon, and the second
                from midday to 1.30pm. The normal single session time is from 10am till noon. There are some Sundays
                when courses will not be held due to the range being required for NZ Defence Force activities, a major
                competition, or the coaches are away at a tournament elsewhere in the country. You can keep track of the
                range programme via the Trentham Camp Archery Club group on Facebook.<br><br>A beginner's course
                consists of eight 1.5 hour lessons. During the course we will teach basic safety, etiquette, care of
                equipment, exercise and get you shooting in a confident manner. Initially you will be trained to a shoot
                recurve bow without sights in order to learn the absolute basics of archery, then from there you will
                progress to learn the principles of shooting with a basic sight.<br>We will provide you with all the
                equipment required for the beginner's courses. Please do not run and buy equipment prior to starting the
                course as we have found that in many cases people have purchased unsuitable items.<br><br>At the
                conclusion of the beginner's course you will make the decision whether to leave it at that, or to
                progress further in the sport. If you decide to continue you will be asked to join the Club. You can
                carry on shooting with club-supplied equipment for a reasonable period of time during which you should
                be starting to look towards obtaining your own gear. The coaches will be available to advise you as to
                what will be the most suitable equipment for you personally. We will continue to keep an eye on you over
                this time and give you advanced coaching.<br><br>When you gain the confidence and strength to be able to
                shoot longer distances you will be encouraged to join in the club shoots held on the range, and major
                tournaments that are held throughout the country from time to time. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
